    <p>
        A new Date and Time API for JDK 8 is being defined by JSR-310.
        This project is a backport of the API to JDK 7.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please note that this is NOT an implementation of JSR-310.
        Only JDK 8 can contain an implementation of the JSR.
        This project simply mirrors the API in a different package.
        It is intended for use in applications that want an easy
        migration from JDK 7 to JDK 8.
    </p>
