/**
 * <p>
 * <code>StopWatch</code> provides a convenient API for timings.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * To start the watch, call {@link #start()} or {@link StopWatch#createStarted()}. At this point you can:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #split()} the watch to get the time whilst the watch continues in the background. {@link #unsplit()} will
 * remove the effect of the split. At this point, these three options are available again.</li>
 * <li>{@link #suspend()} the watch to pause it. {@link #resume()} allows the watch to continue. Any time between the
 * suspend and resume will not be counted in the total. At this point, these three options are available again.</li>
 * <li>{@link #stop()} the watch to complete the timing session.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * It is intended that the output methods {@link #toString()} and {@link #getTime()} should only be called after stop,
 * split or suspend, however a suitable result will be returned at other points.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * NOTE: As from v2.1, the methods protect against inappropriate calls. Thus you cannot now call stop before start,
 * resume before suspend or unsplit before split.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * 1. split(), suspend(), or stop() cannot be invoked twice<br>
 * 2. unsplit() may only be called if the watch has been split()<br>
 * 3. resume() may only be called if the watch has been suspend()<br>
 * 4. start() cannot be called twice without calling reset()
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>This class is not thread-safe</p>
